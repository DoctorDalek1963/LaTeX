The imaginary number $i$ is defined to satisfy $$\boxed{i^2 \equiv -1}$$.

A complex number $a + bi$ is the sum of a real number and an imaginary number (which is a real multiple of $i$).

Complex numbers are added element-by-element, and multiplied by expanding brackets Ã  la foil.

The \textit{complex conjugate} for a complex number $z = a + bi$ is $z^* = a - bi$.

For a polynomial $f(x)$ with real coefficients, complex roots must occur in conjugate pairs.
