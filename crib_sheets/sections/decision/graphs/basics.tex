	\hline
	Graph & A collection of nodes and edges\\
	\hline
	Node (or vertex) & A point on a graph\\
	\hline
	Edge (or arc) & A line segment connecting two nodes\\
	\hline
	Weighted graph (or network) & A graph with weights associated with its edges\\
	\hline
	Directed graph (or digraph) & A graph where the edges only go one way\\
	\hline
	Subgraph & A subset of the nodes and vertices from the original graph\\
	\hline
	Degree (or valency, or order) & The number of edges connected to a given vertex\\
	\hline
	Walk & A route through a graph, connecting vertices along edges\\
	\hline
	Path & A walk in which no \textit{vertex} is visited more than once\\
	\hline
	Trail & A walk in which no \textit{edge} is visited more than once\\
	\hline
	Eulerian circuit & A trail which starts where it ends and traverses every edge\\
	\hline
	Cycle & A walk which ends where it started, and no other vertex is visited more than once\\
	\hline
	Hamiltonian cycle & A cycle that includes every vertex\\
	\hline
	Connected (vertices) & There is a path between the vertices\\
	\hline
	Connected (graph) & All the vertices in the graph are connected\\
	\hline
	Loop & An edge that starts and finishes at the same vertex\\
	\hline
	Simple graph & A graph where there are no loops and there is at most one edge connecting any\\[-0.3em]&pair of vertices\\
	\hline
	Tree & A connected graph with no cycles\\
	\hline
	Spanning tree (of graph $\mathbf{G}$) & A subgraph of $\mathbf{G}$ which contains all vertices and is a tree\\
	\hline
	Complete graph & A graph in which every vertex is directly connected by a single edge to all other vertices\\
	\hline
	Isomorphic graphs & Graphs which represent the same information but are drawn differently\\
	\hline
