\sectitle{Poisson}

The Poisson distribution is used to model a situation where an event occurs at a fixed rate.

You can model $X$ as a Poisson distribution if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The events must occur independently
	\item They must occur singly in space or time
	\item The events must occur at a constant average rate
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	If $X \sim \text{Po}(\lambda)$, then \formulaBookBox{$\displaystyle P(X = x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^x}{x!}$}
	\ $\constraint{x \geq 0}$
\end{center}

\sectitle{Geometric}

The Geometric distribution is used to model a situation where you try an event several times until a success occurs, and you want to know how many tries it will take.

You can model $X$ as a Geometric distribution if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each attempt is independent
	\item Each attempt has the same probability
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	If $X \sim \text{Geo}(p)$, then \formulaBookBox{$\displaystyle P(X = x) = p(1 - p)^{x - 1}$}
	\ $\constraint{x > 0}$

\end{center}

\begin{empheq}[box=\rememberBox]{alignat*=2}
	P(X \leq x) &= 1 - (1 - p)^x\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &
	P(X \geq x) &= (1 - p)^{x - 1}\\[1ex]
	P(X > x) &= (1 - p)^x\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &
	P(X < x) &= 1 - (1 - p)^{x - 1}
\end{empheq}
